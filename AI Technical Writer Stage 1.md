## ✍️ Prompting Basics

Claude responds best when you:
- **Give context** → "You are a YouTube scriptwriter..."
- **Set the tone** → "Write in a casual, Gen Z style..."
- **Add examples or formatting** → "Use bullet points" or "start with a hook, then 3 points..."

### Claude Settings to Note:
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness (lower = more focused, higher = more creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Controls length of output (usually set automatically in Poe)
- **Model Version**: Use **Claude 3 Opus** for most accurate results

```

Write a 20-second script hook and call to action for a video titled: “Why Gen Z Loves Silent Vlogging.”

```

### 📜 Script Structure Prompt

## 💡 Tips for Better Output
 | Tip                   | Why It Works |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Be Specific**     | Claude responds better to details like tone, audience, or format |
| **Use Examples**  | “Here's a sample intro:...” shows Claude what you want |
| **Test Iterations**         | If the first output isn’t quite right, try rewording or adding instructions|
| **Roleplay**   | Set Claude’s role clearly: “You are a brand strategist…” |

## 🚫 Limitations
- **No real-time info** - Claude doesn't know what happened today or yesterday
- **Sensitive to phrasing** - Slight changes to prompt wording can produce very different outputs
- **Can be repetitive** - May overuse phrases or give generic responses if not guided
<br><br>

## 🪜 Next Steps
- **Save prompts as templates** - Use Notion or Google Docs to build a personal prompt library
- **Compare Claude with other models** - Try the same prompts in ChatGPT, Gemini or DeepSeek
- **Integrate Claude into your workflow** - Use it for first drafts, brainstorming, and structure - not as a final editor
